# Digital Twin & Prescriptive Optimization
Currently creating a digital twin of a manufacturing system and developing a prescriptive optimization model utilizing NIST datasets and ProModel, 
then using Python and Gurobi to identify bottlenecks and determine optimal parameters to minimize cycle times and maximize system throughput.
